# Jira Worklog V2
Now bloated with tons of (extreamly useful and not used in producation) dependancies

## Getting Started

Make sure you have bower and gulp installed
`sudo npm install -g gulp bower`

Install depedancies
`npm install`

Watch for changes
`grunt watch`

Build static files
`grunt build`

## TODO

1. Overhaul UI with materialize and sass
2. Improve and debug modules
3. Drop gulp and move to webpack?
4. Unit/E2E testing
5. Dockerify
